# FrontEnd Workflow Template

Workflow template that I use on my Front-End projects that utilizes webpack and gulp 4 and produces production ready output.

## How to use:

-   Clone
-   Run npm install
-   Run gulp watch

Project is set so that all editing, aside from HTML, happens within the src folder. SASS is used for the css, although SCSS works as well. I also added an auto-prefixer for the css, and both the css and js output is minified and will create folders that are already linked in the initial index.html.
